        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>It is not widely known that certain models of diesel vehicles from the 70s-80s are able to run on waste vegetable oil rather than the expensive diesel gas you get at the pump. Vegetable oil is used and disposed by countless restaurants every single day and any regular person can purchase these containers for next to nothing, and sometimes even for free!</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, due to the refinement and complexity of modern combustion engines, the last models of diesel cars to run on WVO without any modifications were manufactured in the mid 1980s. Luckily for us, these were some of the most well built automobiles ever made and their engines have been proven over decades to have bulletproof reliability due to their ability to withstand much higher compressions than normal petrol based engines.</p>
        <p>Most of the diesel market is in Europe, and because of that the selection for these cars here in the states is extremely limited when compared to our friends across the Atlantic, however there are still plenty of great options to choose from. Here are a few: </p>

        <h2 id="cars">Mercedes-Benz 300TD (W123)</h2>
        <p1>1976-1985  # Produced: 2,696,914</p1>
        <p>The W123 chassis Mercedes was synonymous with diesel reliability, the w126 was the most commercially successful diesel of the 70s and 80s with the most units still operating on the road today. These cars are quite easily found today with an abundant supply of parts.</p>

        <h2>BMW 524TD (E28)</h2>
        <p1>1981-1988  # Produced: under 200,000</p1>
        <p>A much less common car than the W123 Mercedes, but what it lacked in mainstream appeal, luxury, and reliability; it made up in speed. Back in the 1980s the 524TD was the fastest diesel vehicle ever produced, going from 0-60mph in 11.5 seconds, those are petrol numbers.</p>

        <h2>Volvo 240DL</h2>
        <p1>1974-1993  # Produced: ???</p1>
        <p>The only Sweedish member of this list, the volvo 240 is a legendary chassis of car, met with supreme reliablity, excellent performance in snow, and the best reliability features out of any car in this class.</p>
